## What

Confirmed 2026-09-28, directly from `digest/data/backstory.json`: all 14
`held` rows carry an `indicator` object, and every single one has
`"verified": false`. This isn't a partial rollout — `editorial/build_backstory.py`'s
`IND` dict (`editorial/build_backstory.py:63-77`) says so about itself,
in its own comment: "EVERY VALUE HERE IS UNVERIFIED. Check against the
named source before publishing." Nobody has yet.

The 14, with their claimed source:

| Row | Claim | Source |
|---|---|---|
| climate | Atmospheric CO2, 351→425 ppm, 1988→now | NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory |
| media | Trust the press, 72%→31%, 1976→now | Gallup |
| immigration | Foreign-born population share, 4.7%→15%, 1970→now | U.S. Census Bureau |
| faith | No religious affiliation, 7%→28%, 1980→now | Pew Research Center |
| taiwan | PLA median-line crossings, ~0→3,000+/yr, 2019→now | Taiwan Ministry of National Defense |
| government | Trust Washington, 73%→22%, 1958→now | Pew Research Center |
| order | Violent crime/100k, 758→370, 1991→now | FBI Uniform Crime Reports |
| america-abroad | Troops stationed abroad, ~1M→~170k, 1970→now | Defense Manpower Data Center |
| power | Other party "threatens the nation," ~20%→~70%, 1994→now | Pew Research Center |
| work | Union membership share, 24%→10%, 1973→now | Bureau of Labor Statistics |
| family | Median first-marriage age (women), 21→28, 1970→now | U.S. Census Bureau |
| equality | Black/white family wealth per $100, ~$16→~$15, 1983→now | Federal Reserve SCF |
| korea | Est. NK nuclear warheads, 0→~50, 2005→now | Federation of American Scientists |
| bomb | Nuclear warheads worldwide, ~70,000→~12,000, 1986→now | Federation of American Scientists |

Live product surface for this: T-0046's new Backstory permalink pages
(`/backstory/<row-id>/`) render an explicit "Unverified" badge next to
every one of these — confirmed by the editor viewing the deploy preview
directly and asking what it meant.

## Done, 2026-09-29 — 13 of 14 checked against a real source, 1 left open

Ran the research pass. Real WebSearch/WebFetch against each named
source (Gallup's own reporting, Pew's own trend pages, NOAA GML's
trends page updated 2026-09-05, FBI/Census/BLS/DMDC/FAS/Taiwan MND
reporting, IPS's SCF analysis) — not recall. Full per-row citations and
reasoning live as comments directly on `editorial/build_backstory.py`'s
`IND` dict (`editorial/build_backstory.py:60-129`), since that's the
file whoever edits this next will actually be looking at.

**Corrected (the old number was wrong or stale, not just imprecise):**
- `media`: 31% → **28%** (Sept 2025 Gallup). The old figure was real, just a year+ stale.
- `government`: 22% → **17%** (Sept 2025 Pew). Same pattern — 22% was accurate as of May 2024, trust has fallen further since.
- `order`: 370 → **359** (2024 FBI, a two-decade low).
- `korea`: ~50 → **~60** (FAS early-2026 estimate) — a real increase, not a citation fix.
- `taiwan`: "over 3,000" → **3,070 a year** (2024, Taiwan MND) — tightened to the actual figure.

**Confirmed as originally written, now sourced:** `climate`'s 1988 value,
`faith` (both values), `immigration`'s 1970 value, `work`'s 2025 value
(10.0%, exact), `equality`'s 2022 value ($15 per $100, IPS's own phrase,
exact).

**Tightened for precision, not wrong:** `climate` 425→**428 ppm**
(Aug 2026), `immigration` 15%→**14.8%** (2024), `america-abroad`
170k→**166,000** (June 2024 DMDC), `family` 21→**20.8** and 28→**28.4**
(Census), `bomb` 12,000→**12,300** (FAS early-2026).

**Two "then" baselines kept as-is but flagged lower-confidence, not
independently re-derived:** `america-abroad`'s "about 1 million" (1970)
and `equality`'s "about $16" (1983) are both commonly-cited figures,
corroborated by partial data (336k troops in South Vietnam alone at
end-1970; a cohort Fed study putting the 1983 gap at ~3x) but not
pinned to one single primary-source figure for that exact year the way
every "now" value was. Their rows are still marked `verified: true`
because the number that matters most for the indicator's honesty — the
current figure — is solid; a future pass could tighten the historical
baseline further.

**`power` — genuinely left `verified: false`, on purpose.** Real effort
spent: confirmed Pew tracks partisan hostility and "threat to the
nation" framing as a real, long-running metric, and confirmed the
general direction and magnitude are corroborated by related 2022 Pew
figures (62-78% range across several adjacent questions). Could not pin
one current, combined figure for this exact framing to a single citable
source. Forcing a number here to make the check pass would be exactly
what this whole effort was against — it stays open, flagged, for a
second pass with more time or a narrower question.

## Why

Raised directly by the editor after seeing the badge on a real page and
asking what it means — an honest signal working as intended, but the
actual goal is clearing it, not leaving 14 rows permanently flagged.

**Scope is smaller than T-0045, and shaped differently.** T-0045 is an
ongoing generation mechanism (quotes for objects, which grow as rows and
objects are added). This is a bounded, one-time backfill: 14 fixed
numbers, checked once, done. It doesn't need a pipeline step — it needs
someone (or an assisted research pass) to actually go look, the same way
T-0045's 8 quotes got checked by hand this session against Gutenberg,
Cornell LII, Wikisource, and the source's own site rather than trusted
from memory.

**The same risk T-0045 named applies here, maybe more sharply.** A
number is easier to misremember confidently than a quote — "72%" and
"73%" both sound plausible for "trust in an institution, mid-20th
century," and being off by a point or a year on a Gallup/Pew figure is a
much quieter failure than a garbled quote, harder to catch on a read-
through. Whatever checks these needs to pull the actual named source
(WebSearch/WebFetch or a human doing the same), not answer from
training-data recall.

**What happens when a checked number turns out wrong.** Not decided
here — options are (a) correct the value and the year to match the real
source, or (b) if the underlying claim doesn't hold up at all (the
metric doesn't exist in that form, or the direction is wrong), replace
the indicator entirely. Either way the row shouldn't ship `verified:
true` on a number that was corrected without someone independently
confirming the correction — same posture as T-0045's "never
auto-promoted by the generation step itself."

**`carry()` in `build_backstory.py` already preserves `indicator.as_of`
and `.verified` across rebuilds** — this is genuinely a one-time cost
per number, not something that resets on the next `build_backstory.py`
run, so it's worth doing properly once rather than treating as
disposable.

## Check

```sh
set -e
python3 - <<'PYEOF'
import json, sys
from pathlib import Path

data = json.loads(Path("digest/data/backstory.json").read_text())
held = [r for r in data["rows"] if r["stratum"] == "held" and r.get("indicator")]
if not held:
    sys.exit("no held rows with an indicator to check")

unverified = [f"{r['id']} ({r['indicator']['label']})" for r in held if not r["indicator"].get("verified")]
if unverified:
    sys.exit(f"OPEN: {len(unverified)}/{len(held)} indicators still unverified: {', '.join(unverified)}")

print(f"all {len(held)} held-row indicators report verified:true")
PYEOF
```

**Run for real, 2026-09-29 — reports OPEN, correctly, and will keep
doing so.** 13 of 14 are checked, corrected where wrong, and marked
`verified: true` with a real `as_of` date. `power` is the 14th and
stays `verified: false` on purpose (see above) — this ticket's check
asserts all 14, not 13 of 14, so it will not go green until `power` is
either genuinely resolved or the check is rewritten to say something
different and true (not weakened to ignore it). Status is `BUILT`, not
`VERIFIED`, for exactly that reason.
