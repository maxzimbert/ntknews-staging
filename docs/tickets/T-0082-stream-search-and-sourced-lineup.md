## What

Asked by the editor 2026-10-09, two things.

**Stream search.** A box at the top of Stream: type words or phrases separated by commas, press
Enter, and a new manual cluster is made from every match. Each term is a phrase; any one matches.
Sources are the current window (title match, whole words) plus EventRegistry through a new
`news.js` mode, `keyword-search`, called twice: `pool=ntk` (the 91 `NTK_SOURCES`) and `pool=top`
(ER's top 20% of sources, the same bar as `scan-broad`). 7-day window, 15 per pool, sorted by
relevance. The cluster then behaves like any manual one (suppress, extract, rescan, → lineup).

Measured on main (aa4edc5) before this: Pulse's two existing "search EventRegistry" buttons send
`mode=keyword-search`, which `news.js` did not have, so they fell through to the default branch:
a keyword search with **no publisher filter and no date window**. Those buttons now get the
filtered mode too, since they send the same mode name (they send no `pool`, so they get the NTK
list).

**Sourced Lineup.** After "clear all stories" the empty Lineup bootstraps from `lineup.json`.
Any edition story whose cluster had aged out of the stream went in with `articles: []`. On
2026-10-09, 3 of 67 edition stories had no cluster in the stream and 10 carried no recorded
`urls`. Now: a story falls back to the `urls` that `lineup_promote.py` recorded; a story that
still has no URL is left as a candidate, never auto-inserted. The editor can still add it by
hand. Bootstrap also waits for `clusters.json` to answer, because `lineup.json` can land first
and make every story look sourceless.

Verified 2026-10-09 on localhost: with four edition clusters removed from the stream, one with
a recorded URL and two with none, a cleared Lineup refilled to 8 with 0 sourceless stories; the
URL-less story stayed a candidate. Against production's `news.js` (no mode yet), the search kept
its window results and reported the missing mode instead of using the unfiltered fallback.
After merge (9c605d3), the production function answered `keyword-search` with the tag for both
pools: `pool=ntk` returned only NTK-list outlets (usatoday.com, cbsnews.com), `pool=top` returned
Yahoo Sports, Economic Times, USA Today. The Pages Pulse served the search box. Not verified: a
search run by the editor inside the Pages Pulse.

## Why

The editor's rule is that what the machine recommends must be sourced. A Lineup slot with no
URLs gives Jefferson nothing to write from and looks like a recommendation. It is also invisible
until generation fails.

The search has a quality bar because "relevant" is not enough. ER's top 20% still admits
Breitbart, Yahoo UK and Mint; that is ER's bar, and the editor asked for "ours or ER's". The
`pool=top` call is the one to tighten if that turns out too loose.

Cost: two ER requests per search (a few ER tokens each).

`news.js` tags this mode's response (`ntkMode`). The reason: Pulse runs on GitHub Pages and
calls the production Netlify function, so a Pulse change can be live (or on staging) before the
function is. Without the tag, that gap silently becomes an unfiltered search. Ruled out:
filtering by source rank in the browser (ER's percentile isn't in the default response).
