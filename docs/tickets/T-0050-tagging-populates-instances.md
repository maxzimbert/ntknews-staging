title: Tagging a story to a Backstory row in Pulse never reaches the row's Earlier episodes
status: DISCARDED
tags: [backstory, feature]
anchor: editorial/build_pairings.py:283

## What

**Discarded 2026-10-01, replaced by T-0062.** The editor decided `instances[]` should carry a row's Beginnings, and that "earlier episodes" is simply "In the digest" extended to prior stories from recent digests. The reasoning below is kept as it was written.

A row's `instances[]` is its "Earlier episodes" list: past digest stories
tagged to that row, each with headline, date and permalink. The detail view
renders it (`bsrEpisodesHtml`, `digest/index.html`). Measured 2026-09-29:
`instances` is empty on all 21 rows of `digest/data/backstory.json`, so the
section never renders.

**Acceptance criterion:** when the editor tags a story to a row with the
Pulse tagging control (T-0010) and publishes, that story is appended to that
row's `instances[]`, once, and stays there across later publishes.

Stories the editor did not tag are not appended. `todays_pairings` is
overwritten every publish and nothing else writes `instances`, which is why it
is empty. `build_backstory.py` already preserves `instances` across rebuilds
(`PRESERVE_ROW`, line 81), so persistence needs no new work.

## Why

This is the link between a Backstory row and the digest articles behind it,
which is the relationship the tab exists to build. `register4-lifetimes.md:23`
puts most news in the episode list rather than the narrative ("Most news is
instances"). With the list empty the detail view is an indicator, some
objects and a "hasn't been written yet" line. Expertise (Profile) also needs
a per-row list of stories to join against, and there is none.

**Why the tagging control and not the classifier.** The editor's hunch, and
the safer path: a tag the editor made is reviewed editorial
(`build_pairings.py` says so at its T-0010 block), while a classifier pick is
a model's guess. An instance is permanent, so a wrong classifier tag becomes
a permanent wrong episode. Cost: the lists fill slowly, since the editor does
not tag eight stories a day (T-0010 keeps blank = "let the classifier decide"
as the default). That is the tradeoff being accepted.

**Other pathways, ruled in or out for later, not for this ticket:**

- *Append every pairing, classifier included.* Fills fastest, no API cost,
  but bakes classifier errors into history. `needs_review` (confidence below
  the threshold) could gate it, at the price of sparse lists. A later slice
  if editor-only proves too thin.
- *Backfill from git history.* `backstory.json` has 8 commits and dated
  digests go back to 2026-09-14, so earlier tags could be reconstructed. Not
  assessed; unverified how clean it is. Only editor tags survive as
  reviewed, and the tagging control is recent.
- *Editor prunes or reorders instances in Pulse.* Not needed until lists
  grow. Suggest capping at the newest 10 to 15 per row so the list stays
  finite.

**Implementation notes, unverified.** The permalink is
`/digest/<date>/<slug>/`, built by `build_digest.py` (`slugify`,
`unique_slugs`). `pulse-publish.yml` runs `build_digest.py` before
`build_pairings.py`, so the slug exists by then, but whether
`lineup-publish.json` carries it or `build_pairings.py` must recompute it was
not checked. Dedupe on `story_id` so a republish does not double-add. The
pairings step is `continue-on-error` by design (T-0013), so a failure here
must not block a publish.

Touches T-0010 (the control), T-0011 (identical cards, unaffected: episodes
only show in the detail view) and T-0014 (classifier pre-fill, which would
make tags easier to review and so supply this list faster).
