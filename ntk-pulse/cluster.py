"""NTK Pulse — Layer 2: Cluster (v2, experimental).

Three changes from the live cluster.py, all aimed at under-segmentation
(mega-clusters that glue distinct stories together):

  FIX 1 — IDF-WEIGHTED ENTITIES. The live join gate counts shared entities:
    one shared entity + cosine >= 0.12 joins. But "iran" appears in ~200 of
    today's articles and "Muwaffaq Salti" in 3, and the gate treats them as
    equal evidence. v2 weights each shared entity by its rarity, so a shared
    obscure name is strong evidence and a shared ubiquitous one is nearly
    none. This subsumes the hand-added "trump/white house" blocklist —
    rarity is measured fresh every run instead of maintained by hand.

  FIX 2 — COHESION SPLIT. After clustering, check whether a cluster's
    internal similarity is unimodal. A real single-story cluster is tight;
    a glued-together one shows two dense lumps with a gap between them.
    Where the gap is real, split it. Structural, not tuned to a topic.

  FIX 3 — BRIDGE DETECTION. An article roughly equidistant from two strong
    centroids — high similarity to both, clearly nearer neither — is a piece
    genuinely about both stories. Today it gets force-assigned to whichever
    it's 0.01 closer to. v2 pulls these out into their own cluster, which is
    an editorial primitive, not just cleanup.

Stdlib only. Same I/O contract as cluster.py.

# ── FIX 4: velocity ──
# Yahoo's "Alike" watched article-volume velocity and social chatter; our
# ranking only ever saw a static snapshot (publisher_count + recency), so a
# story going 2→12 publishers in an hour scored the same as one sitting at
# 12 all day. This computes acceleration from arrival timestamps WITHIN the
# existing window — no cross-run state, no new API calls.

VELOCITY_WEIGHT = 0.5       # how hard velocity pushes, as a fraction of the
                            # diversity term. 0.5 => at most ±25% of pubs*0.5.
VELOCITY_CLAMP = 3.0        # cap the raw ratio so a 2-publisher burst can't dominate
BREAKING_MIN = 1.35         # relative-to-median velocity to call something breaking

# NOTE on the null hypothesis: uniform arrival is NOT the right baseline.
# The window always ends "now" (whenever the pipeline ran) and RSS polling
# bunches arrivals near poll time, so on real data the median cluster scores
# ~1.6 against a uniform null — i.e. almost everything looks like it's
# accelerating, which makes the signal useless. Velocity is therefore
# normalized against the median cluster IN THE SAME RUN: self-calibrating,
# adapts to each window's shape, and 1.0 always means "typical for today."
