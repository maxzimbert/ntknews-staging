"""NTK Pulse — Layer 3: The Story Ledger.

Epistemic deduplication — the machine version of "no increments."

Each story that survives triage (verdict YES or MAYBE) gets a persistent
ledger: the canonical record of what is already known (actors, numbers,
documents, quotes, state of play). Every new item in the cluster is diffed
against the ledger by Claude Sonnet and classified:

  DEVELOPMENT — evidently adds a new actor, number, document, or on-record
                quote, or changes the state of play. Surfaces to the editor.
  INCREMENT   — restates the ledger with trivial delta. Logged, not surfaced.
  RECYCLED    — aggregation of aggregation. Logged; counts toward velocity only.

Ledgers persist in data/ledgers.json ACROSS the 48h window (long-running
stories keep their memory). Matching: shared item ids first, entity overlap
for stories that resurface after a gap. Inactive ledgers expire after 14 days.

Also extracts per-item "unique contribution" (the LLM angle pass) and
first-reported-by credits, in the same call — one Sonnet call per cluster
per run, only for triage survivors with un-diffed items, capped.

BODY LIMITATION (still true in Pulse): the diff judges headline + RSS summary,
not full article bodies. Enrichment — the only place Pulse has real bodies —
runs client-side in pulse.html at lineup time, AFTER this pipeline stage has
finished. So the Digest Assembly spec's "extraction must run against enriched
bodies" is NOT satisfied here. News writing frontloads new facts, so this
catches most developments, and it is enough to drive the assembly rubric's
increment constraint and the "N new facts since you last looked" promise.
Full-body diffing requires the ledger to run after enrichment — either moving
it client-side or moving enrichment server-side. Neither is in scope here.
"Judge on evidence" is therefore a hard rule in the prompt: if the summary
shows nothing new, it's an INCREMENT even if the body might contain more.

CONTRADICTIONS (new in Pulse): the diff also flags when an item contradicts
something already established in the ledger — a reversal, a denial, a corrected
figure. This is material the Lies section needs and previously could not see.

Usage:
  python ledger.py          # real run (needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
  python ledger.py --mock   # deterministic offline classifications for testing

Stdlib only.

DIFF_PROMPT = """You are the ledger editor for NTK News, a daily digest whose core promise to readers is: no increments. Your job is epistemic deduplication — deciding whether each new article adds to what is already known about a story.

THE LEDGER (everything already established about this story; empty fields mean a brand-new story):
{ledger}

NEW ITEMS (headline + RSS summary only):
{items}

Classify each new item:
- DEVELOPMENT — it evidently adds a new named actor, a new number, a new document, a new on-record quote, or it changes the state of play. The first items of a brand-new story are DEVELOPMENTs.
- INCREMENT — it restates the ledger with trivial delta: fresh prose, same knowledge.
- RECYCLED — aggregation of aggregation: it evidently derives entirely from other outlets' coverage (markers: "reports say", "according to [outlet]", roundup framing) and adds nothing.

Hard rules:
- Judge ONLY on evidence in the headline and summary. If they show nothing new, the item is an INCREMENT even if the full article might contain more.
- A different angle on known facts is still an INCREMENT unless it introduces a new fact — angles are captured separately in "unique".
- "unique" answers: what does this piece alone contribute? A source nobody else has, a document, an evidenced contrarian thesis, an on-the-ground scene. Empty if nothing distinctive.
- "credits": outlet names this item credits for the reporting ("first reported by X", "according to X"). Empty list if none.
- "contradicts": if this item contradicts something already established in THE LEDGER above — a reversal, a denial, a corrected figure, a walked-back commitment — state it in under 25 words: what the ledger held, and what this item asserts instead. Empty string if nothing is contradicted. Be strict: a new development is not a contradiction. Only flag a genuine conflict with an already-established fact.
- ledger_updates must contain ONLY facts evidenced by these items. Rewrite state_of_play ONLY if a DEVELOPMENT changed it; otherwise return an empty string for it.

CRITICAL JSON FORMATTING: your response must be strictly parseable JSON. Inside any string value: escape every double-quote as \\", escape every backslash as \\\\, escape every newline as \\n. Do NOT use smart quotes (\u201c \u201d \u2018 \u2019) inside string values — use straight quotes and escape them. If a source headline contains an apostrophe (Graham's, Trump's), preserve it as-is — apostrophes do not need escaping. If it contains a double-quote, escape it. Failure to produce valid JSON breaks the entire pipeline for this story.

Respond ONLY with JSON, no preamble, no markdown fences:
{{"items": [{{"id": "<item id>", "class": "DEVELOPMENT"|"INCREMENT"|"RECYCLED", "what_new": "<the specific new fact, under 20 words; empty unless DEVELOPMENT>", "unique": "<distinct contribution, under 15 words; else empty>", "credits": ["<outlet>"], "contradicts": "<under 25 words, or empty>"}}], "ledger_updates": {{"actors": [{{"name": "", "role": ""}}], "numbers": [{{"value": "", "what": ""}}], "documents": [""], "quotes": [{{"who": "", "gist": ""}}], "state_of_play": ""}}}}"""
