"""NTK Pulse — NPR newscast monitor (T-0037).

Scrapes NPR News Now's show page (not the RSS feed — the feed only keeps
~3 episodes; the page keeps ~10 hours), transcribes each hourly newscast
with whisper.cpp, and extracts the topics it covered. Purely a monitoring
signal for the editor — what NPR's desk is covering and how it changes
hour over hour, surfaced in Pulse's Lineup tab above the recommendations
zone. Deliberately does NOT match against clusters.json or feed anything
back into assembly/triage — see docs/decisions.md before changing that;
it was a live design question, resolved as "monitoring only, for now."

Why local whisper.cpp and not a hosted ASR API: transcribing ten ~5-minute
clips a day costs nothing on a whisper.cpp binary (a full day of audio
transcribes in minutes on ordinary hardware). A hosted per-minute API
would be a new vendor and a new secret for a job that's free to run as
stdlib + one system binary + one model file.

Requires (system, not pip):
  - whisper-cli + a ggml model (path below) — brew install whisper.cpp locally;
    the workflow builds it from source and caches the binary
  - ffmpeg (preferred) or afconvert (macOS-only fallback, local testing)

Topic extraction is Haiku, same call pattern as triage.py (stdlib urllib,
x-api-key header). Skips gracefully with no ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, same as
triage.py — an episode without a key just has no topics until a run with
one reaches it; capture() and thread() both still work on raw transcripts.

Stdlib only otherwise.

Usage:
  python newscast.py capture   # scrape, download, transcribe new episodes
  python newscast.py label     # Haiku: extract topics for un-labeled episodes
  python newscast.py thread    # group today's topics into hour-over-hour rows
  python newscast.py           # all three, in order
