"""NTK Pulse — Layer 5: Digest Assembly.

Implements the Digest Assembly & Mix Rubric. This is the layer that decides
what the edition IS, as opposed to what the stream contains.

The problem it exists to solve, stated plainly: publisher_count is
simultaneously the quality signal and a catastrophe filter. Wire services
converge on disaster; a first-in-class drug approval, a school phone-ban
result, or a piece of genuine wonder gets covered once. Sorting by
corroboration therefore produces a digest that is accurate, defensible, and
grim every single day. Assembly fixes that by filling SLOTS and enforcing
SET CONSTRAINTS rather than taking the top N off a ranked list.

Two slot plans, switchable, meant to be A/B tested:

  PLAN A (rubric §3) — slots by reader relationship: Unavoidable, Money & me,
    Body & mind, Work & machines, The group chat, Elsewhere but here, Flex,
    The close.

  PLAN B (Standing Lineup v0.4 R16) — 4 hard news + 4 reserved drawn from
    science / health / tech / longevity / parenting.

Set constraints run AFTER slot filling and do the real editorial work — the
doom-stack cap in particular is the direct fix for "this mix is depressing."

Reads  data/clusters.json  (needs triage scores; ledger annotations optional)
Writes data/lineup.json    (the edition, plus a full audit trail)

Stdlib only. No API calls — every judgment used here was already made and
paid for upstream in triage.py and ledger.py.
