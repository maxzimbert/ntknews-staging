"""NTK Pulse — Stream to Lineup, automatic promotion.

Runs on the cheap 20-minute schedule, right after triage. Watches every
fresh clustering pass for anything that's cleared real corroboration —
2 or more independent publishers — and, if it isn't already represented
in the current lineup, adds it. No approval step. This is what makes
"new and juicy" actually flow, rather than waiting up to 4 hours for the
next full assembly run.

Deliberately additive, never destructive:
  - Existing lineup.json entries (whether from assembly.py's own selection
    or a previous promotion run) are never touched or removed.
  - A cluster already represented — even under a DIFFERENT key, since keys
    drift as the window rolls — is recognized and skipped rather than
    duplicated. Recognition is URL-overlap first (see the note below),
    falling back to the original entity+cosine title match for stories
    that don't have recorded URLs yet, or for genuinely URL-disjoint
    coverage of the same event.
  - assembly.py's next full run (every 4 hours) does its own complete,
    more careful selection and naturally supersedes whatever this script
    added in between. That's intentional, not a bug: this script's job is
    faster visibility, not final editorial judgment.

Dedup (2026-08-14): title-fuzzy-matching missed real duplicates because the
*articles* underneath a story are stable across runs but the *representative
headline* cluster.py picks can drift as the window rolls — title similarity
is exactly what breaks when phrasing drifts. A sturdier signal sits one
level down: do a candidate's member URLs overlap an already-promoted
story's URLs? The same AP/Reuters piece keeps the same canonical URL run
after run no matter how the representative headline gets reworded around
it. URLs are canonicalized before comparison. Title-fuzzy-match is kept as
a fallback for what URL-overlap can't see: two genuinely different
articles, from different publishers, independently covering the same event
with no shared source piece.

Roundup filter (2026-08-14): "Weekly culture roundup," "Movie review
roundup," and similar clusters aren't single stories — they're a
publisher's own aggregation of several unrelated items. The 2+ publisher
bar doesn't distinguish that from a real story, so it gets its own check,
applied before dedup: a roundup-titled cluster is never eligible for
promotion.

Progress-singleton path (2026-08-14): "our paper is more about who's
making progress than who's screwed up." Publisher count is simultaneously
the pipeline's corroboration signal AND its catastrophe filter — wire
services converge hard on disasters, while a story about a fix in motion
often runs as a singleton by nature (one outlet followed the thread). The
2+ publisher bar structurally punishes exactly the stories this bias wants
to elevate, for reasons that have nothing to do with whether they're true.
This does not lower the bar — it substitutes a different verification
signal for singletons specifically: triage.py's progress_coded verdict
(a real editorial judgment call, not a keyword match) AND a source-tier
floor (tier 1 or 2 — audited 2026-08-14: tier 3 is a genuinely mixed bag,
not a clean quality signal, so it's excluded rather than trusted). A
singleton has to clear BOTH to be promoted this way.

Reads  data/clusters.json (this run's fresh clustering)
Reads  data/lineup.json   (if present — never required to exist)
Writes data/lineup.json   (existing entries preserved, new ones appended)

Stdlib only, same posture as the rest of the pipeline.
