"""
Compose a Backstory category automatically (T-0079).

The pairing step (build_pairings.py) already does two things well without the editor: it files each
story under a row, and it writes the one-line "Today" sentence. This is the third thing in the same
spirit. When a story fits no row, the pipeline names a category for it and composes the page: contest,
stakes, the histories to draw on, Beginnings and objects picked by rule, the lines written, a trend line
found by search. Pulse is where the editor reviews and revises it afterwards; nothing waits on a click.

Nothing here is trusted by the site. The record goes through categories.validate, which drops what fails.

The prompts are the same as the ones in ntk-pulse/pulse.html (composeCat, writeObjectText,
proposeIndicator). They are written out twice, once per language, and should be kept in step.

First ask yourself: what is the history of the action, the consequences, the people, the setting and the background in this story? Which events, in order, are the steps that lead to what the story reports today? Choose the {need} that matter most, spread across time, earlier than today's event, the last one the most recent turn before it. Then use web search to find, for each, a primary source that defends it from editorial scrutiny: the document itself or the copy held by an archive, court, legislature, government agency or the original publisher. Not Wikipedia, not a news article or summary about it, not a retail or study-guide page.

Every milestone must be part of this story's own history: the same subject, an earlier instance of the same action, or the origin of a background the story names. A document that shares only a theme (secrecy, government power, regulation) is an analogy and does not belong. {need} is a target, not a quota: if you cannot source a milestone, leave it out. Fewer well-sourced milestones are better than padding.

CATEGORY: {rec['title']}
CONTEST: {rec.get('contest') or '(not written yet)'}
STORY FILED UNDER IT: {headline}

Use web search to find a real published figure at its original source (the pollster, agency, court, statistics office or organisation that ran the survey), not an article repeating it. Prefer a measure asked the same way at two dates, or a rate published as a series. Then answer with JSON only:
{{"label":"what is measured, as a reader would say it","then_value":"42%","then_year":"2025","now_value":"75%","direction":"worse|better|contested|flat","source":"the organisation","source_url":"the exact page where you found both figures","as_of":"month and year of the latest figure","evidence_quote":"one sentence copied word for word from that page that states both figures","note":"one sentence on what the two figures are"}}
Rules: both figures must be stated on the page at source_url, in the form you give, and evidence_quote must be copied exactly from it. Do not estimate or calculate. "direction" describes the figure, not your opinion of it: use contested when a rise or fall is not clearly good or bad. If you cannot find such a pair, answer {{"none":"why"}}."""

2. contest: ONE sentence ending in a full stop, "Whether X, or Y", two positions a reasonable person holds. 12 to 30 words.
3. stakes: TWO short sentences, 25 to 55 words in all, framed as the open questions the argument turns on (whether, when, by whom, who benefits). Do not write about "risks" in the abstract or "who pays". Write about the category as a whole, not about one story.
4. lenses: choose from the supported lenses only the one or two the category is NAMED for. A lens is for a country, alliance or technology. Do not add a lens because it appears in one incident or is a related topic.
5. subgenres: choose up to two from the sub-genres above that name the American argument this category belongs to, exactly as written, if it belongs to one. Choose at least one lens or one sub-genre: a category needs a history to draw on.
