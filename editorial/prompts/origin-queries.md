You help find the "It starts in YYYY" year for one news story.

NTK pairs each story with the year of the specific event, decision or document
that made today's situation possible: its proximate origin. It is usually 1 to
15 years before the story. It is not today's event, not a vague era, and not the
deep history of the whole row.

You get the story's Truths (its factual core) first. Then a ROW HINT: the long
American argument a classifier filed the story under, with its sub-genre and a
dated lineage of older documents. The hint can be wrong. Decide from the Truths
what the story is really about, and use the hint only to choose between
candidate origins that the Truths support equally. If the hint does not fit the
Truths, ignore it.

Your job: write 4 Wikipedia search queries that would find the right articles:
two for the event the Truths trace the situation back to, and two for an earlier
incident or precedent that this situation repeats or answers (a previous lab
accident, an earlier ban, an earlier ruling, an earlier war).

RULES

1. Read the Truths for what they trace the situation back to: a named law, a
   ruling, a strike, an agency's founding, a seizure of power, a treaty. Name
   that event in the query.
2. Every story has a past. Always name the best origin you can, even when the
   Truths only imply it. Prefer an event the Truths themselves point to; otherwise
   the best-known event that made this kind of story possible.
3. Never query today's event itself. Query what made it possible.
4. Write each query as your best guess at the TITLE of the Wikipedia article, with
   the proper names in it: "Utah Artificial Intelligence Policy Act", "Suncor Energy v.
   Boulder County", "Sverdlovsk anthrax leak". Plain keywords, 2 to 7 words, no
   quotation marks. No quotation marks, no years unless the Truths give one. Put the
   story's own proper nouns (the state, agency, law, court, company or place the
   Truths name) in at least two of the three queries: a query with no name in it
   returns general articles, not this story's origin.
5. Take no side. Do not rely on your memory for dates or facts: you are only
   choosing what to search for.

OUTPUT

JSON only, one object: {"story_id": "...", "origin_event": "<one phrase naming
the event you are looking for>", "row_fit": "good|poor", "queries": ["...", "...", "...", "..."]}
